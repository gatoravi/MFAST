This is code from the NEWICK UTILITIES project. The MFAST project would have taken exponentially longer time to develop without the Newick Utilities project and we are extremely grateful to the authors for having made the code open-source. Thanks Guys, and Great Job !

"The Newick Utilities have been described in an Open-Access paper (that is, available online for everyone):
