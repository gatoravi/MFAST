Look at pipeline.pl for the set of steps that are followed.

The sequence of steps is as follows, 
1. Find the seeds from the input set of trees for given k, n. This is done by the findPotSeeds.cpp file.

2. Combine the frequent seeds using either min overlap or IO overlap approach. The code for the min overlap approach is in src/match.c The src folder is from the Newick Utilities project.

3. Post process the combined seeds, this is done in the postprocess.pl script.
